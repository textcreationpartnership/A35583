         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt word of Comfort is this,

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 11.11.</note> our Friend</hi> Lazarus <hi>ſleepeth.</hi> A notion which the Diſciples at firſt underſtood not, becauſe their underſtandings were not yet inlightened; they dreamed of a <hi>natural ſleep</hi> ſaith the Text; of <hi>taking Reſt in ſleep.</hi> And yet, as men in their <hi>ſleep</hi> do ſomtimes dream <hi>true,</hi> ſo did they in this dream of theirs, ſpeak truer than they were aware of; they ſaid, Lord, <hi>if he ſleeps, he ſhall do well;</hi> it is true indeed, the Saints of God do but ſleep, when they lye down in the Grave; that, which we call death (in ſuch) is not <hi>death indeed;</hi> It is but the <hi>Image of Death,</hi> the <hi>ſhadow</hi> and <hi>metaphor</hi> of death, deaths younger Brother; a meer <hi>ſleep,</hi> and <hi>no more.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt, who beſt knoweth what things be, hath phraſed it <hi>ſo,</hi> and that, not ſo little as twenty times in Scripture, to ſhew, that it was not a ſudden expreſſion, incautelouſly dropt from the Pen of any one of the <hi>Secretaries</hi> of Holy Writ; but the true, proper,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53915:18"/>and genuine notion of death ſuggeſted to them by the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dictate of <hi>the Spirit of God; they do but ſleep;</hi> and if they ſleep, <hi>they ſhall do well: their ſleep ſhall be ſweet unto them;</hi> as ſweet as once the Prophets was, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.26.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not follow the <hi>Analogy</hi> that is between Death and Sleep, in the latitude of it, ſufficient to our purpoſe it will be, to take notice of two main properties of <hi>Death,</hi> which do carry in them a lively reſemblance of ſleep.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Sleep is but a <hi>partial privation,</hi> a privation of the <hi>Act</hi> only, not of the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Reaſon.

               <p>A ſecond Connexion between Chriſts Reſurrection,

Hence it is, (as I have hinted before) that our Lord calls himſelf <hi>the Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>the Life,</hi> namely to intimate to us, that by the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of holineſs, whereby he raiſed himſelf from the dead, he will alſo quicken their mortal bodies. This is a <hi>ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,</hi> which inſeparably links in the Reſurrection of the Saints with the Reſurrection of Chriſt: For ſurely, were it not ſo, the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt would ſignifie no more, than the Reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or any other of the Saints mentioned, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.52, 53. Yea, the Reſurrection of Chriſt would not be of ſo great vertue, and influence, as the dry bones of the Prophet, the very <hi>touch whereof raiſed the dead man,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly; Nor is it an Union only of <hi>aſſent in point of doctrine</hi> and <hi>judgment,</hi> though ſo much it is, for ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the name of all Believers. <hi>We have the mind of Chriſt.</hi>

<note place="margin">Fides quae cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur.</note> is called an <hi>in being in Chriſt,</hi> John 15.4.6. and an abiding in Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.24.28. <hi>Scil.</hi> a <hi>profeſſional or doctrinal</hi> Union with Chriſt.

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly; Nor yet is it merely an Union of <hi>conſent;</hi> The Believer is not one with Chriſt, <hi>only</hi> by <hi>conſent of wills.</hi> The <hi>Arrians</hi> whilſt they blaſphemouſly deny the <hi>Deity</hi> of the Son, betray a double ignorance (and if but ignorance, there ſin is the leſs) the one in the <hi>doctrine,</hi> or <hi>aſſertion</hi> it ſelf; the other in the ground, which they alledge for it, which is Chriſts own words, praying to his Father for Believers, <hi>John</hi> 17.22.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53915:30"/>that they may be one, <hi>even as we are one;</hi> whence they (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Believers to be one with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> only by <hi>conſent of wills</hi>) do infer, neither are the <hi>Father and the Son one</hi> in any other ſence.

<note place="margin">Idem velle, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem nolle vera eſt amicitia.</note> and that is a very ſweet and precious union: to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>nill</hi> the ſame things, is an high degree of love and <hi>oneneſs;</hi> but to ſay <hi>no more</hi> of the Union betwixt Chriſt and his Saints, is to ſay <hi>too little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly; Neither is this Union barely a <hi>Sacramental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> whereby Chriſtians (in either of the Sacraments, or any other Evangelical inſtitution) are in an <hi>Elemental profeſſional</hi> way joyned to Chriſt, and Chriſt to them. Thus all, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad, Elect</hi> and <hi>Reprobate, Simon Magus</hi> as well as any of the <hi>Believing Samaritans,</hi> Acts 8.12, 13. <hi>Judas</hi> as well as <hi>Peter:</hi> all I ſay, are made <hi>one with Chriſt</hi> in an external <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional</hi> uſe of thoſe Goſpel-inſtitutions; while in the mean time a <hi>real Believer,</hi> in a <hi>true, living, ſpiritual, ſaving</hi> way, is made partaker of Chriſt, and of all his benefits in all Goſpel-Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly; In contradiſtinction to the Union which we have with Chriſt, by vertue of his <hi>aſſuming our humane nature.</hi> Chriſt was incarnate in the Womb of the Virgin, and thereby was <hi>perſonally</hi> united to our <hi>fleſh;</hi> which is the higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the humane nature, that can be conceived, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>For verily he took not upon him the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> Chriſt aſſumed <hi>mans nature,</hi> being <hi>God</hi> from all Eternity; he <hi>took</hi> on him the <hi>one,</hi> to the <hi>other;</hi> and ſo made of thoſe two natures, <hi>one perſon:</hi> by this we have a kind of Union with Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>He which Sanctifieth, and they which are Sanctified, are both of one,</hi> i.e. of <hi>one God,</hi> ſay ſome; the Son of God, and Saints are all of one God <hi>the Father:</hi> others underſtand it of <hi>Adam;</hi> Chriſt as concerning the fleſh, and all the <hi>ſanctified,</hi> are of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>root</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> though, by a <hi>different generation.</hi> But <hi>[of one]</hi> here is to be referred principally to the <hi>nature,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               <p>Secondly, As Chriſt will bring their Souls with him from Heaven, ſo he will bring <hi>their bodies from the Grave.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Or, as ſomtimes in <hi>the days of his fleſh,</hi> he did to <hi>Lazarus,</hi>

               <p>I ſhall not ſtay here to inquire into the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the Saints bodies, when Chriſt ſhall raiſe them up out of their Graves: that inquiry will be more proper and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in ſome of the following clauſes of this context.</p>
               <p>Concerning the manner of it (for the help of our Infant-underſtandings) briefly,
<note place="margin">The manner of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> we may conceive it after this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The holy Angels of God ſhall be ſent abroad, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together the ſcattered duſt of the Saints, though ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one from the other at never ſo great a diſtance into all the quarters and extremities of the earth,
<note place="margin">Math. 24.31.</note> and ſhall bring them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53915:41"/>together,
<note place="margin">Math. 24.31. The incinera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their duſt ſhall have a Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in the Reſurrection.</note> not ſo much as one <hi>duſt</hi> wanting (for he that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the Stars, doth number alſo the duſt and aſhes of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed): <hi>as</hi> not an hair of their heads, <hi>ſo</hi> not a duſt of their reſolved fleſh ſhall periſh.</p>
               <p>Thus gathered together, Chriſt by his mighty power ſhall unite duſt to duſt, every duſt in its own <hi>proper</hi> place, and form it up into the ſame numerical body it was, when it was diſſolved and laid down in the Grave.</p>
               <p>And thus made up into a <hi>beautiful Structure,</hi> (more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than ever it was in its firſt Creation, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter); Chriſt will put each <hi>Soul</hi> into its <hi>own</hi> body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and unite them together into the ſame <hi>ſweet</hi> conjugal <hi>ſociety and fellowſhip</hi> they poſſeſſed before their ſeparation; this friendly eſpouſed Pair, ſhall now be ſolemnly Married together, before God, and Men, and Angels, never to ſuffer Divorce any more, and they ſhall become one entire <hi>perſon,</hi> a <hi>totum compoſitum,</hi> as they were in the days of their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>
               <p>And this excellent perſon will Chriſt animate, and quicken with the influences of that bleſſed Union with himſelf, which during all this long interval of their ſleeping in the Grave, was not <hi>diſſolved,</hi> but <hi>hidden</hi> only, and <hi>ſuſpended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſhall the <hi>Saints</hi> know, and feel the meaning of that word which Chriſt ſpake to <hi>Martha, I am the Reſurrection, and the Life. Martha</hi> in the verſe immediately before, had profeſſed her Faith of a Reſurrection. — <hi>I know that my Brother ſhall riſe again, in the Reſurrection at the laſt day:</hi> Preſently <hi>Chriſt replieth,
<note place="margin">Jo. 11.25.</note> I am the Reſurrection and the Life:</hi> diſcovering to her the Fountain and Cauſe of that Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; namely, that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> ſhall then go forth <hi>from himſelf</hi> to animate and quicken all his Members, and ſhall cauſe them to ſtand upon their feet again, <hi>as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>Soul and body thus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited,</hi> Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> ſhall bring with him unto the place where the great Aſſizes of the quick and dead ſhall be ſolemnly kept, which the 17th. <hi>v.</hi> tells us will be in the <hi>Air</hi> (of which more <hi>diſtinctly</hi> when

<note place="margin">Secondly. In reference to the Saints departed.</note> It is a word of <hi>comfort in</hi> reference <hi>to the Saints departed,</hi> our precious Relations; the ſenſe of whoſe loſs and abſence we are not able to bear, while we think of them <hi>as ſmothered,</hi> and extinguiſht in their own aſhes, <hi>ſilent</hi> in the land of forgetfulneſs, in whoſe ſweet converſe, we were wont to ſolace our ſelves with much delight, their ſouls having left the habitation of their bodies, and their bodies reſolved into duſt, and that duſt (poſſibly) mixt with the duſt of wicked men, or of the brute Creatures, it may be, diſperſed into the remoteſt part of the world. Ah theſe be ſome of the heart-dividing thoughts, wherewith we do afflict our Souls! But give check to your paſſions, Oh ye mourners of hope, and make uſe of the Cordials which your Heavenly Phyſitian hath preſcribed to keep you from <hi>fainting.</hi> Remember, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their <hi>bodies are</hi> in <hi>the Grave,</hi> their Souls are <hi>with the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, beholding the face of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which is in Heaven, from whence Jeſus Chriſt, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when he ſhall come in the glory of his Father, attended with all his mighty Angels, will bring them with him.</p>
               <p>And then ſhall he go to their Graves, and as he formerly ſaid unto them, Come my people, enter into thy Chambers, ſhut the <hi>doors about thee,</hi> go to bed in the Grave, and take thy <hi>reſt;</hi> ſo now he will awaken them out of their ſleep with a <hi>ſweet</hi> voyce, <hi>Awake, and ſing you that dwell in the duſt, Ariſe,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53915:43"/>ſhine, for thy light is come, the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. yea, he will kiſs them awake, with the kiſſes of his <hi>mouth;</hi> and then as a <hi>Father,</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> will give the <hi>Soul</hi> in <hi>Marriage</hi> to the <hi>Body</hi> again, and unite them one to another, and both to Himſelf in an indiſſoluble bond.</p>
               <p>Oh Chriſtians! think with your ſelves what a joyful meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that will be; when two ſuch ancient Friends, that have been parted ſo long, ſhall <hi>meet,</hi> and <hi>embrace,</hi> and <hi>kiſs</hi> one another, never to ſuffer any more <hi>Divorce,</hi> or fear of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, to Eternity! How will the Soul bleſs God, when it ſhall receive its <hi>own body</hi> again, it's true <hi>Yoak-fellow and Fellow-labourer,</hi> which laboured with it <hi>much in the Lord,</hi> and which was wont to be its <hi>Oratory,</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> wherein the Soul performed all its <hi>Sacra,</hi> its holy devotions, <hi>in ſeaſon</hi> and <hi>out of ſeaſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how will the Body rejoyce to ſee the Soul again, to whom it was <hi>eſpouſed,</hi> which was the <hi>guide of its youth,</hi> that (in its capacity) which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to the <hi>Soul,</hi> it's King, Prieſt, and Prophet, and by vertue of whoſe conjunction with it, the very body, as poor and mean as it was in its <hi>original</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, was <hi>preferr'd</hi> and <hi>admitted into Fellowſhip,</hi> and <hi>Communion with the Son of God;</hi> and (upon that account) <hi>not forgotten</hi> all the while it ſlept in the land of forgetfulneſs, and thought not of it ſelf: I ſay, Solace your ſelves with the <hi>praeviſion</hi> of that Triumph and Exultation that will fill this bleſſed <hi>new-Married couple!</hi> eſpecially, when they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one another ſo much <hi>more excellent</hi> than <hi>themſelves</hi> at their laſt parting; that the body ſhall ſeem to be <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſentiated</hi> into <hi>a Soul,</hi> and the Soul transformed into an <hi>Angel of Light;</hi> Rejoyce, O Chriſtian Soul, to think how theſe two <hi>morning Stars</hi> will ſing for joy, in this their new and for ever bleſſed Conjunction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Thence follow them (in your Contemplations) following the Judg to the <hi>place,</hi> where the <hi>Thrones ſhall be</hi> erected for judgment, and there placed on Thrones, not as <hi>Spectators</hi> only, but as <hi>joynt-Commiſſioners.</hi> Where, the Saint of <hi>a day,</hi> ſhall judg <hi>the Sinner of an hundred years old;</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:53915:44"/>yea, they ſhall judg the <hi>Old Serpent</hi> himſelf, and all his infernal Angels; And as that Sentence leaves them, ſo ſhall they remain to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and in the laſt place; Chriſtians, think not ſo much on your precious Relations, as <hi>lying</hi> in the Grave, their Beauty turned into <hi>Rottenneſs</hi> and deformity; think not of them <hi>as</hi> (poſſibly) by a premature death (as you may think) ſnatcht from an <hi>earthly Inheritance</hi> before their time: but think on them as <hi>co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> riding now in Triumph <hi>with him,</hi> and <hi>with the whole general Aſſembly,</hi> and Church of the Firſt born, whoſe names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to take poſſeſſion of their <hi>Inheritance</hi> with the Saints in Light. Thus behold them, not, as they are in the <hi>night</hi> of the <hi>ſhadow of death,</hi> but as they ſhall be in the <hi>morning</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> when God will <hi>bring them with him;</hi> and, I had almoſt ſaid, <hi>Mourn if you can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for the Sixth word of Comfort.</p>

<list>
                     <item>1. The firſt is, an <hi>obviating</hi> and removal of a <hi>diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> and temptation which might poſſibly be upon the ſpirits of <hi>dying</hi> Saints, namely, <hi>leſt the condition of the Saints which ſhall be found alive at the laſt day, ſhould be happier,</hi> or (at leaſt) <hi>ſooner happy, than the Saints which are fallen aſleep long before;</hi> and the removal of this diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, makes a <hi>ſeaventh Word</hi> of Comfort in this <hi>Model.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. A ſecond word is, <hi>The coming of Chriſt,</hi> his laſt appearance; the <hi>Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend,</hi> &amp;c. and this is the <hi>eighth word</hi> conteined in this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</item>

                     <hi>Seventh word of</hi> Comfort.</note> the next word of Comfort in this Model, is, The <hi>obviating</hi> or removing an objection or diſcouragement, which (probably) might poſſeſs the Spirits of God's dying-Saints: and that is, leſt the Saints which <hi>ſhall be found alive at the laſt day,</hi> might (poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) be <hi>happier,</hi> or (at leaſt) <hi>ſooner happy, than the Saints which are fallen aſleep before that day.</hi>

The <hi>living</hi> Saints ſhall not prevent the <hi>dead</hi> Saints <hi>in any priviledg of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> or of the appearance of the Lord Jeſus. It might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be a temptation upon the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> (or other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans):
<list>
                  <item>1. Either that the <hi>Saints only</hi> which ſhould be found <hi>alive</hi> at the laſt day, ſhould have the happineſs of ſeeing the Lord Jeſus coming in his Glory, with all his mighty Angels (to judg the world) and they <hi>only</hi> ſhould enjoy the priviledg of his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearance; that all the Saints that died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that day, even from the beginning of the world, were a <hi>loſt generation,</hi> that ſhould never come forth again to the light, or to behold the glory of that day, or to enjoy the bleſſed fruits and conſequences of it.</item>
                  <item>2. Or (at leaſt) that <hi>they</hi> ſhould be the <hi>firſt</hi> in that happineſs to ſee his Glory, and have the firſt ſhare in the <hi>felicities</hi> and <hi>triumph</hi> of that day, or ever the <hi>ſleeping Saints</hi> ſhould be awakened or get out of their beds of duſt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle doth therefore, (I ſay) <hi>peremptorily</hi> and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively remove this ſcruple and fear out of the minds of Chriſtians; he aſſures us that it is an utter miſtake, it is neither ſo, nor ſo; he tells us that all Believers who had died from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53915:46"/>the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> downward until the coming of the ſecond <hi>Adam, ſhall have as good a ſhare (caeteris paribus)</hi> in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and glory of that day, as they who <hi>ſtand upon their feet,</hi> and are found <hi>inter vivos,</hi> at Chriſt's coming.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and <hi>as ſoon;</hi> the living ſhall not <hi>prevent</hi> the dead in any one of the beatitudes and honours of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt. They ſhall neither go forth to meet this glorious <hi>Bridegroom one moment</hi> ſooner than their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that are in their <hi>Graves;</hi> nor ſhall they <hi>ſee him coming in his</hi> Glory, <hi>one moment ſooner;</hi> nor conſequently, be owned <hi>by</hi> Chriſt, or received <hi>by</hi> him, or taken up <hi>to</hi> him, or be placed upon Thrones <hi>with</hi> him, or receive their <hi>abſolution and juſtification from</hi> him, or their <hi>glorification with</hi> him, <hi>one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before</hi> their <hi>fellow-Saints</hi> that are yet in their <hi>dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, this is a comfortable word, even in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of it. Believers may lye down to ſleep in their beds of duſt, not only with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s <hi>even-Song.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>But then, How much ſtronger Conſolation doth the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part afford? which, although it lye in the cloſe of the next <hi>verſe,</hi> yet it being the main branch of the Apoſtle's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, whereby he ſatisfieth the doubt of the dying Servants of God, <hi>(ut ſuprà)</hi> we muſt of neceſſity ſpeak of it here alſo <hi>with the Negative;</hi> at leaſt ſo far as it referrs to the Apoſtle's ſcope, reſerving the conſideration of what ſpecial and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53915:47"/>peculiar Import the words carry in them, to their own place.</p>
            <p>We are therefore to take notice that the <hi>affirmative part of</hi> the Apoſtles ſatisfaction to the Saints doubt, or objection, lieth in theſe words,
<q>
                  <hi>The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He doth exactly ſtate the method of Chriſt's procedure at the laſt Judgment,
<note place="margin">Affirmatively. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That the firſt buſineſs which ſhall be then tranſacted, ſhall be the <hi>awakening</hi> and raiſing all the Saints of God out of their Graves, which from <hi>Adam,</hi> until that moment, have ſlept in the duſt: <hi>The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt;</hi> nothing ſhall be done, till that be done. The very firſt work Chriſt will do at his Coming, will be, <hi>to ſend forth his Angels</hi> with a great ſound of a Trumpet, firſt <hi>to awaken the Elect out of their</hi> ſleep;
<note place="margin">Math. 24.31.</note> 
               <hi>[Awake you that ſleep in the duſt;] and then to gather them from the four winds, from the one end of Heaven to the other;</hi> and when they ſhall have put on their Wedding garments, to conduct them <hi>in State</hi> and Triumph to meet with their <hi>Royal Bridegroom</hi> now comn forth (more than half way) to meet them, and to <hi>conſummate</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> which was long ſince <hi>Contracted</hi> in the day of their <hi>Eſpouſals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were eaſie to enlarge here, but, in a word, the <hi>ſum</hi> of this <hi>Affirmative account</hi> is this, That the Saints <hi>who ſleep in the Grave</hi> at Chriſt's coming, ſhall be ſo far from being made <hi>leſs happy,</hi> or <hi>later happy</hi> in the coming of Chriſt, than the Saints who then ſhall be found <hi>alive,</hi> that they ſhall be <hi>firſt remembred;</hi> the <hi>firſt care Chriſt will take</hi> when he comes in the Clouds, ſhall be not about the <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Primitiae Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectionis.</note> but <hi>the dead Saints, The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi> They ſhall be the <hi>firſt Fruits of the Reſurrection.</hi> They that have ſlept ſo long in their beds of duſt,
<note place="margin">Ab illis ordo Reſurrectionis incipiet.</note> ſhall be <hi>firſt awakened,</hi> before any thing be done about them that never ſlept; They that were <hi>uncloathed,</hi> and ſaw corruption in the <hi>Grave,</hi> muſt firſt have their bodies cloathed upon with <hi>incorruption;</hi>

            <p>Some conjecture,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.2.4.</note> the Apoſtle had this myſterie revealed to him, at what time he was rapt up to the <hi>third Heaven,</hi> and there heard <hi>unſpeakable words,</hi> amongſt which one was this comfortable Doctrine, that the <hi>living Saints</hi> ſhall not prevent the <hi>dead Saints</hi> in <hi>any glorious priviledg of the Reſurrection,</hi> which was an <hi>Arcanum</hi> or <hi>Myſterie</hi> not formerly made known to the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is but a <hi>conjecture</hi> which carrieth with it little <hi>probability:</hi> The Apoſtle telling us (in the ſame place) that the <hi>words</hi> he heard in that <hi>Extatical Viſion</hi> were <hi>

            </p>
            <p>Others therefore conceive that this was a <hi>myſtery revealed</hi> to <hi>none</hi> but to the <hi>Apoſtle himſelf;</hi> and that not unto him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he <hi>wrote this Epiſtle,</hi> and ſo <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Others there are that (waving both theſe Conjectures,) are apt to think this <hi>myſtery</hi> (ſo called, becauſe it was not commonly underſtood in the Church,) to be none other than the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which <hi>our Lord</hi> himſelf delivered by <hi>word of month,</hi> in the <hi>dayes of his fleſh,</hi> concerning the <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> for which,</p>
            <p>Some would make us beholding to <hi>Tradition:</hi> but others more <hi>rationally,</hi> ſuppoſe the Apoſtle to entitle this Doctrine

            </p>
            <p>So that, the doctrine here laid down, as it is a word <hi>of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfort to dying Saints,</hi> and to their ſurviving Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;

            </p>
            <p>From hence, (by the way) we are <hi>informed</hi> of theſe <hi>two things,</hi>

               <hi>There is no ſure and infallible foundation for our faith to ſtand upon, but the word of God.</hi> Thither therefore the Holy Ghoſt ſends us,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.20.</note> 
               <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> The Apoſtle himſelf would not aver ſuch a ſolemn truth as this is, but from the mouth of Chriſt himſelf.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> is <hi>Scripture;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>That which may be inferr'd from Scripture, by natural</hi> and <hi>neceſſary conſequence, is to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Scripture it ſelf.</hi> The word of God <hi>rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,</hi> is the word of God. Thus our Lord himſelf,
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.27.</note> proves the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> out of the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> by <hi>inference</hi> and <hi>deduition</hi> from the words which God ſpake to <hi>Moſes [I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob,] he thence inferrs, [God being not the God of the <hi>dead,</hi> but of the <hi>living.</hi>] that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, are alive</hi> in their <hi>better</hi> part, <hi>ſc.</hi> their <hi>Souls,</hi> and ſhall live again in their inferiour part, <hi>ſc.</hi> their <hi>bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the holy Apoſtle here inferreth this <hi>comfortable</hi> truth, that the <hi>dead Saints ſhall loſe nothing</hi> by their not being found <hi>alive</hi> at Chriſts coming; from Chriſt's own doctrine of the Reſurrection in <hi>general:</hi> And doubts not to honour it with this <hi>Title,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>CHRIST, the principal efficient Cauſe:</hi> The <hi>Son of man ſhall come in the Clouds,</hi> and ſhall ſend his Angels, and <hi>ſhall gather</hi> the Elect from the four winds, <hi>from the uttermoſt part of the Earth, to the uttermoſt part of Heaven.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet doth not this exclude the <hi>Miniſtry of the Angels;</hi> Chriſt may make uſe of them in the ſeparation of the Elect, from the Reprobate; and this is expreſly affirmed by our Lord Himſelf;</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Angels ſhall come forth,

               <p>It ſeemeth not improbable that the <hi>Congregation</hi> ſhall be <hi>called together</hi> by <hi>ſound of Trumpet:</hi> for though ſome (both <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Modern</hi>) do underſtand all, that is ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Trumpet ſounding, metaphorically;</hi> yet doth the phraſe of Scripture favour their opinion more, who underſtand the ſpeech of a <hi>literal</hi> ſounding the Trumpet:

And why may we not think that as the <hi>Trump</hi> is uſed in order to the Saints <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> ſo alſo there may be uſe made of it, in order to their <hi>gathering together,</hi> when they are raiſed? May not this be ſuggeſted from <hi>Math.</hi> 24.31. though neither the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> nor the <hi>Congregating</hi> of them together, are effected <hi>properly by</hi> this ſound; it being not a <hi>Phyſical,</hi> but a <hi>moral inſtrument</hi> only, or <hi>ſignal;</hi> 'Tis not the <hi>ſound</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi>

               <p>We ſhall be caught up to meet the Lord <hi>in the Air;</hi> That is the place where Chriſt ſtays for his Saints: <hi>There,</hi> they <hi>meet him;</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> this great <hi>Oecumenical Aſſize</hi> will be held. The Judge ſhall ſit upon the <hi>Throne,</hi> and all the Saints ſhall be placed on bright Clouds, as on <hi>ſeats</hi> or <hi>Scaffolds round about him;</hi> The Wicked remaining (below) upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> there to receive their final <hi>doom</hi> and <hi>ſentence;</hi> and <hi>from thence</hi> to be drag'd <hi>away,</hi> by the Executioners of divine Vengeance, <hi>Infernal Spirits;</hi> to the place of Execution (the <hi>bottomleſs-Pit,</hi>) yet ſtanding; and (to the greater aggravation of their horror) looking on.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may ſuffice for anſwer, The <hi>Lord Jeſus hath made choyce of this place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the priviledg of <hi>earthly Judges</hi> in their <hi>Circuits,</hi> to <hi>appoint the place</hi> where they will keep their <hi>Aſſizes</hi> or <hi>Seſſions,</hi> wherein if <hi>ſtat pro ratione volunt as,</hi> their <hi>will</hi> is a ſufficient <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> ſurely, it is not leſs the prerogative of this great <hi>Judg</hi> of the <hi>quick</hi> and the <hi>dead,</hi> to appoint the <hi>place</hi> where he will
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53915:79"/>hold this <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>tremendous</hi> Judgment. And we may well acquieſce in the <hi>choyce,</hi> not only becauſe his <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Law</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> but as his <hi>inſinite Wiſdome</hi> hath judged it the place moſt convenient for the deſigne.</p>
               <p>And yet (if it be lawful to make our Conjectures, where Scripture is ſilent) we may humbly ſuppoſe this two-fold Account of it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Capacity of the Place.</item>
                  <item>2. The Conſpicuity of the Judgment.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Capacity of the Place; Vaſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Place?</note> and <hi>(as to us) inſinite</hi> will be the numberleſs numbers of thoſe that do meet in this <hi>univerſal Aſſembly.</hi> Behold, the <hi>Lord will come with ten thouſands of his Saints;
<note place="margin">Jude 14.</note> Yea thouſand thouſands miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtand before him; All the Saints that ſlept in Jeſus from the Creation of man, and all the Saints which are found alive upon the Earth</hi> at Chriſts Coming, muſt all appear before the <hi>Lord Joſus.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, the Judge cometh with his Royal <hi>Satellites,</hi> his <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> Myriads and Legions of <hi>Angels;—All his holy Angels,</hi> Math. 25.31. There ſhall not be an Angel (as it were) left in Heaven as it were. <hi>Jacob</hi> met two <hi>Hoſts</hi> or <hi>Camps</hi> of Angels of God, in his Travel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.12. Our Saviour mentions more then 12 Legions, which as a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded party,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 26 53.</note> would have been (in an inſtant) ſent out for his reſcue, (if there had been need). What an infinit Army of Angels muſt it needs be then, when <hi>all</hi> the Angels come in Chriſt's Train? <hi>An innumerable company of Angels?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.22.</note> And all theſe muſt not appear in confuſed heaps and multitudes, but in their diſtinct <hi>ranks</hi> and <hi>order;</hi> and the Saints are to ſit in <hi>Order,</hi> in their ſeveral <hi>degrees</hi> round about the Throne.</p>
               <p>Why now, the <hi>Place</hi> had need be of an <hi>huge extent</hi> and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, that will ſuffice to receive and contain ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of multitudes: So that even in this reſpect, no place ſo fit for this Auguſt and ſolemn <hi>Convention,</hi> as the <hi>Air;</hi> for its vaſt extenſiveneſs and capacity. But</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:53915:80"/>
               <p>Secondly: Much more in reſpect of <hi>Conſpicuity,</hi> that ſo, the <hi>Judg</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> with all the <hi>Aſſeſſors</hi> and <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</hi> might be more <hi>eminently viſible</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi> above, to the <hi>Earth</hi> beneath, that the whole <hi>proceſs</hi> of this general <hi>Aſſize</hi> may be <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>ſeen</hi> by <hi>all, good and bad; Elect and Reprobate; Heaven and Hell. Heaven</hi> would be too <hi>high,</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> would be too <hi>low;</hi> the ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit would obſcure this glorious viſion: The <hi>Air,</hi> (where is no interpoſition of <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Mountains,</hi>) and now, ſerened and brightned by the confluence of ſo many <hi>glorious Suns,</hi> will render this <hi>laſt tremendous Tranſaction, viſible and audible</hi> to every Creature. Behold, he cometh with Clouds! <hi>Clouds,</hi> which will not <hi>obſcure</hi> him, but <hi>bright Clouds,</hi> which, filled with the <hi>beams</hi> of <hi>his glory,</hi> ſhall render him moſt <hi>viſible and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 24.30. Rev. 1.7.</note> So it is Propheſied, <hi>Every eye ſhall ſee him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thus</hi> it ſhall be, and <hi>this</hi> will make for the exceeding <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the <hi>Judg,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For thus it is (even) in <hi>humane Judicatories</hi> upon Earth, the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of the <hi>Judg,</hi> and <hi>Bench of Aſſeſſors,</hi> is erected in open Court, and lifted up on high in the ſight of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that all may ſee and hear the whole judicial procedure of the Law, with the <hi>poſſe Comitatus</hi> attending in Arms for the greater ſolemnity and honour of the <hi>Judge.</hi> Upon the ſame accompt hath our Lord made choyce of the <hi>Air</hi> to keep his great Arſize in, there to erect his <hi>Royal Throne,</hi> and to place <hi>ſeats of Judgment</hi> for all the Saints to ſit upon, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; all the holy Armies of Angels ſurrounding them. This will make Chriſt <hi>very glorious</hi> in the eyes of all the Spectators. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall</hi> come in the <hi>glory of</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>his own glory.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> ſends the <hi>Son</hi> about this great Work of the laſt Judgment, with as much pomp and glory as can be put upon him, for the <hi>recompencing</hi> of the <hi>ignominy</hi> and <hi>abaſement</hi> of his firſt coming in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>I come now to the <hi>ends</hi> of this Meeting; And the ends why the Saints aſcend to meet Chriſt in the Air, we may conceive to be ſuch as theſe:

                  </note> and to be <hi>Righteous</hi> are <hi>two different capacities,</hi> conſiderable in one and the <hi>ſame perſon;</hi> it is <hi>one thing</hi> for a man to be conſidered meerly as <hi>not Guilty</hi> (or purely <hi>as</hi> an <hi>abſolved</hi> perſon,) <hi>another thing</hi> to be conſidered, <hi>as</hi> a <hi>Righteous perſon, inveſted</hi> with all thoſe excellent <hi>qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi>

                  <hi>So</hi> it is between <hi>not-Guilty</hi> and <hi>Righteous;</hi> there is not a perſon, who is neither, <hi>not-Guilty,</hi> and yet <hi>not-Righteous;</hi> for although the conſiderations be <hi>unſeparable,</hi> yet they are not identical: <hi>Not-Guilty</hi> is not the ſame notion with <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; that</hi> is purely <hi>privative,</hi> this <hi>poſitive:</hi> though they are ever <hi>

               <p>The Perſon under the notion of <hi>not-Guilty,</hi> is an <hi>abſolved</hi> perſon, and acquitted from <hi>Hell</hi> and eternal damnation: And, as under the notion of <hi>Righteous,</hi> he is capacitated for Heaven and life everlaſting: <hi>Not-Guilty</hi> relates to <hi>freedome</hi> from <hi>Hell: Righteouſneſs,</hi> relateth to <hi>Heaven,</hi> as the proper qualification thereof: <hi>Do this</hi> and <hi>Live;</hi> though, where the one is, there is the other, yet the one is not formally the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And according to theſe two <hi>capacities</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> there are two great Works, which the Redeemer did undertake for the Redeemed: The one to make <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for ſin to <hi>divine juſtice</hi> by his <hi>Blood,</hi> i. e. by his <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other to yield moſt <hi>abſolute Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Law of God,</hi> both in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>one,</hi> we may conceive the Redeemed <hi>freed</hi> from <hi>Hell</hi> and everlaſting burnings; by the <hi>other,</hi> we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them <hi>qualified</hi> for <hi>Heaven</hi> and everlaſting Glory.</p>

               <p>Yet, not ſo preciſely, neither the one or the other, but that <hi>both</hi> may be produced by <hi>both: Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may have a joynt influence upon both; his <hi>Active</hi> to ſave from Hell; and his Paſſive to bring to Heaven: As a man that payeth a <hi>debt,</hi> and purchaſeth an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> either of them to the value of <hi>five hundred pounds</hi> (at the ſame time) with a <hi>Jewel</hi> worth a <hi>thouſand,</hi> one half whereof relates to the <hi>debt,</hi> the other to the <hi>Purchaſe;</hi> yet ſo, as it is hard to diſtinguiſh <hi>which</hi> is done by <hi>which;</hi> there is a diſtinct conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in it, yet ſo, as that <hi>both</hi> concurr to <hi>both:</hi> ſo in the caſe in hand.

               <p n="1">1. A poſitive Righteouſneſs is neceſſary for the <hi>ſetling of ſolid Peace in the Conſcience</hi> of the Sinner. The Peace and Comfort of a poor <hi>ſenſible Sinner,</hi> can never ſtand firm and ſtable, but upon the <hi>baſis</hi> of a <hi>poſitive Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is one of the great Arguments, whereby the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in his <hi>Chriſtian Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That way of Juſtification, which tends <hi>moſt effectually to ſettle Peace in the Conſcience of a poor Convinced Sinner,</hi> that muſt needs be God's way of Juſtification:</p>
               <p>But Juſtification <hi>by Faith</hi> is the moſt effectual <hi>medium</hi> to this end. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I come now to the fifth Object in the beatifical Viſion, which is the <hi>Divine Eſſence:</hi>
               <note place="margin">5th Object The Divine Eſſence.</note> This is denied by ſome, and well it may, if the aſſertion were ſo to be underſtood, that the eſſence of God is to be diſcerned by the <hi>bodily eye,</hi> though in its <hi>glorified capacity;</hi> for where ever the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency be which God will put upon the glorified bodies of the Saints in Heaven, yet ſtill they retain the nature of <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal beings,</hi> and Gods eſſence is ſo infinitely <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> that the Angelical nature compared with it would ſeem to be but <hi>quid materiale,</hi> of a material and corporeal conſtitution; ſo that now to affirm God to be viſible to an organical eye (though glorified) would ſeem to imply one of theſe two things, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that
<list>
                  <item>1. Either the Divine eſſence hath matter and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in it.</item>
                  <item>2. Or that the glorified <hi>ſence</hi> were made altogether <hi>immaterial</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> either of which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the <hi>analogy of faith. Vorſtius</hi> himſelf was aware of this, and therefore, though at firſt he ſeemed to affirm, that the glorified eye being made (as all the reſt of the body ſhall be) <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> might ſee <hi>God, though a Spirit,</hi> yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he ſo explained himſelf, as only to aſſert,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53915:118"/>that from the <hi>divine eſſence</hi> there did flow a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain light, which light (and not the eſſence it ſelf immediately) is the object of the glorified eye its <hi>ſight.</hi> But, that God may be ſeen by the <hi>eye (i.e.</hi> underſtood) of the <hi>glorified underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> cannot be denied by any that believe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or duly conſider wherein the happineſs of the glorified Saints muſt needs conſiſt. But how or in what manner he ſhall be <hi>ſeen,</hi> is that, which by this dim light, which now we ſee by, is wholly undeterminable. The Schoolmen are wont to ſay that the bleſſed ſhall ſee God, <hi>eſſentially,</hi> or by his eſſence, <hi>immediately, intuitively, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively;</hi> not indeed <hi>comprehenſively</hi> as <hi>God ſees</hi> and <hi>knows himſelf,</hi> but yet <hi>comprehenſively</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to <hi>apprehenſively.</hi> Yet ſome of them ſay, that the Viſion of God is not <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive,</hi> but <hi>apprehenſive</hi> only, all make it <hi>intuitive, quidditative, immediate,</hi> and ſome of our own Divines follow them in this <hi>Tenent;</hi> I ſhall give my thoughts of it in a few Concluſions.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>There be ſome Arguments againſt this <hi>immediate intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Viſion, that either cannot,
<note place="margin">1 Concluſion.</note> or (at leaſt) have not been anſwered to ſatisfaction. I will <hi>form</hi> but one only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in which I will ſuppoſe nothing but what is granted by all, which is this, that the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of the bleſſed is not <hi>infinite,</hi> thus,
<list>
                  <item>That which is <hi>infintte,</hi> cannot by a <hi>finite underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> be known ſo as it is <hi>in it ſelf.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>But the Divine eſſence is <hi>infinite.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Therefore, it cannot be known as it is in it ſelf by a <hi>finite</hi> underſtanding.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Major is grounded on a thing <hi>infinite,</hi> which is ſuch as it cannot be paſſed over, ſo as to come to the end
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53915:119"/>of it. Anſwers to this Argument I have met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but ſuch as are either apparently <hi>impertinent,</hi> or elſe do plainly yield the cauſe; of this there will be little doubt, by any that ſhall read over the Diſcourſe of <hi>Giſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Voetius de viſione Dei per eſſentiam;</hi> for in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, the Anſwers to this Argument are out of various Authors, recited and replied unto, and that to ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Concluſion I lay down is this,
<note place="margin">2 Concluſion</note> This immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <hi>intuitive</hi> Viſion is not therefore to be denied, becauſe there are ſome Arguments againſt it which we know not how to anſwer, for there are Arguments for it, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in them great <hi>probability,</hi> and will difficultly be ſolved, and the ſtate of bliſs is ſuch, <hi>as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor did ever yet enter into the heart of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 Concluſion</note> Therefore, <hi>Scripture is to be ſearched,</hi> and if the phraſes thereof do hold out ſuch a <hi>viſion,</hi> we may warrantably <hi>receive</hi> it; if not, it muſt be <hi>rejected,</hi> or at leaſt be left as a Probleme to be <hi>diſputed</hi> rather in the <hi>Schools,</hi> than to be handled in <hi>Pulpits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth Concluſion is this,
<note place="margin">4 Concluſion</note> 
               <hi>The expreſſions of Scripture do not neceſſarily infer an intuitive immediate viſion of the divine eſſence;</hi> This can be proved only by examination of the particular places that are brought by the aſſertors of this Viſion. They are either of the <hi>old</hi> or of the <hi>new</hi> Teſtament.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>old.</hi> The Lords anſwer to <hi>Moſes</hi> is much inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on; <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face; for there ſhall no man ſee my face and live.</hi> All that theſe words intimate, <hi>will be, muſt be</hi> granted, and it is no more than this, That ſuch a full ſight of Gods glory as <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired, is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected till the <hi>duſt</hi> of <hi>mortality</hi> be <hi>blown</hi> out of our <hi>eyes;</hi> the eyes of our mind <hi>now</hi> can no more endure to ſee the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53915:119"/>
               <hi>face</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> than the eyes of an Owl can behold the <hi>Sun</hi> in its noon-day glory; this although it were a groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of the Jews, to infer <hi>natural death</hi> preſently to befal any perſon, that ſhould have a ſight of God, under any <hi>viſible repreſentation,</hi> yet it might well give occaſion to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to make that quick reply, Lord, <hi>if I may not ſee thy face and live, let me dye to ſee thy face.</hi> But how an Argument ſhould from thence be formed, to conclude an <hi>immediate, intuitive viſion</hi> of God in glory, I cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceive; more colour there is in the Apoſtles <hi>phraſe, Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12</note> now I know in part, but then ſhall I know, even as alſo I am known.</hi> Theſe truly are wonderful expreſſions, and ſuch as afford unto us the greateſt ſecurity, that all <hi>privative imperfection</hi> ſhall be done away, and that we ſhall have <hi>as full a ſight of God,</hi> as our natures are capable of, we ſhall have as full a knowledge of the <hi>Divinity</hi> as we can <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> wiſh for, ſuch as ſhall leave no room for complaint, much leſs for envy. Greater things then this I find not are ſaid of the <hi>Theology,</hi> of the <hi>bleſſed Angels,</hi> their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is but this, <hi>They are ever beholding the face of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8.10</note> But let a Syllogiſme be thence formed.</p>
            <list>
               <item>They who ſhall be admitted to ſee God <hi>face to face,</hi> ſhall ſee him <hi>immediately, intuitively, quiddita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>But glorified Saints ſhall ſee God <hi>face to face.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Therefore, They ſhall ſee him immediately, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I will deny the Major, and do deſpair of ever ſeeing it proved from this Text; the phraſe of ſeeing God <hi>face to face,</hi> doth not neceſſarily import <hi>ſuch</hi> a viſion, for then ſhould <hi>Jacob, Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> on this ſide glory have ſeen God <hi>comprehenſively, immediately, intuitively, quiddita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively;</hi> which I preſume none will affirm, nor is there any circumſtance in the tex or context, that ſhould determine it ſo to ſignifie in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſpeech.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53915:120"/>
            <p>Object. <hi>It is ſaid, We ſhall know as we are known!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true: But ſimilitudes do not alwayes <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate,</hi> run upon all <hi>four,</hi> God knoweth us ſo far as we are <hi>knowable;</hi> Do we know God ſo to? It is impoſſible God ſhould <hi>not know</hi> us, but is it impoſſible we ſhould <hi>not know</hi> God? Could he not hide himſelf from us if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? We do not know God in every reſpect as he knows us, therefore it doth not follow from this <hi>phraſe,</hi> that we ſhould know him <hi>quidditatively, immediately, intuitively,</hi> becauſe he knoweth us ſo, unleſs there be ſome other Scripture remaining, on which ſuch a kind of knowledge may be built, and other there is not, unleſs it be that of Saint <hi>John,
<note place="margin">John 3.2</note> We ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Theſe words I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs come nearer the terms of the <hi>Schools,</hi> than any other I could ever obſerve in Sacred Writ; yet neither can theſe (without violence) be extended to the ſeeing of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſence <hi>eſſentially;</hi> my reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>object</hi> here promiſed, is not the <hi>Divine nature or being,</hi> but the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Mediator; and that according to the <hi>nature</hi> which he <hi>aſſumed</hi> in the fulneſs of time, and in which he ſhall at laſt <hi>appear</hi> to judge the world: when he <hi>ſo appeareth, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> i. e. in the brightneſs and fulneſs of his <hi>ſtate of exaltation;</hi> here we ſaw him but in his ſtate of <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> then we ſhall ſee him in his ſtate of <hi>exaltation; As he is ſet on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But it will be objected, What profit is there then of the</hi> beatifical Viſion? Or, <hi>What advantage have they who ſee God in</hi> Heaven, <hi>above the Saints who ſee him in the</hi> Evangelical <hi>viſion?</hi>

            <p>Secondly, We come to <hi>know</hi> (or rather to <hi>gheſs</hi>) what God is by comparing God with the Creature; take in all that is <hi>amiable,</hi> or <hi>formidable</hi> in the Creature; go over all <hi>imaginable perfections</hi> and <hi>excellencies</hi> in the <hi>Creatues, Men, Heavens, Sun, Moon, Stars, Angels,</hi> and aſcribe them all to God, and there you lay a foundation of knowing God, but infinitely ſhort and narrow of what he is; therefore we muſt aſcend.</p>
            <p>For when we have gone through all the ranks and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of perfections in the ſubordinations of created <hi>beings,</hi> when we have ſearched out the utmoſt excellency of each <hi>claſſis,</hi> we may ſay, <hi>this is in God, and more;</hi> whether <hi>Man or Angels</hi> go higher and higher till we come to the

This, I ſay, is all we can reach to, in ſpelling out God, for be it ſaid, we muſt add <hi>infinite</hi> to all theſe <hi>perfections,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> is God, this is alſo by denying; for what is <hi>infinite,</hi> but without <hi>bounds and limits?</hi> That is to ſay, God is <hi>ſtrong</hi> without <hi>weakneſs, wiſe</hi> without <hi>ignorance, holy</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>impurity, &amp;c.</hi> If we would conceive theſe excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, (which ſeem to us to be affirmative) we are glad to be beholding to <hi>negation:</hi> As for example, if I would know what is Gods <hi>eternity,</hi> the <hi>negative</hi> muſt help me, it is his being <hi>without beginning and without end:</hi> What his holineſs?

            <p>In a word, The Saints ſhall know God to <hi>perfection,</hi> though not to <hi>infinitude,</hi> they ſhall ſee him ſo as to <hi>repoſe</hi> themſelves in him with full <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> ſo that they ſhall ſay, they have <hi>enough.</hi> In this life ſome of the Saints, at ſometimes, have had ſuch <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of God, as have made them weep as bitterly (as ever any under deſertion) crying out, Lord withdraw thy glory, elſe the veſſel will ſplit, and I ſhall diſhonour God. And it may juſtly be our wonder, how it ſhould be otherwiſe to the Saints in the other world, a wonder that a <hi>created, finite faculty</hi> ſhould be able to bear the weight of glory, which filleth the infinite Object, and not be deſtroyed by the immenſity of it; eſpecially ſince we read of the very Angels themſelves,
<note place="margin">Omne vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſenſibilo deſtruit ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</note> who in a viſion of ſomewhat an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <hi>nature</hi> to that <hi>facial viſion</hi> in glory, for the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brightneſs of it, are ſaid to <hi>veil</hi> their <hi>faces</hi> and their <hi>feet;</hi> their faces, as having their eyes dazeld with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding brightneſs of his glorious appearance; and their <hi>feet,</hi> as abaſhed in the apprehenſion of their own <hi>meanneſs</hi> and <hi>imperfection,</hi> in compariſon of Gods <hi>incomparable and incomprehenſible</hi> perfections.</p>
            <p>But as to this difficulty.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Our moſt learned Engliſh Annotator upon that place tells us, that thoſe expreſſions ſignifie rather the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſs</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53915:123"/>of the <hi>Angels</hi> reverence and fear, in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the <hi>Supreme Majeſty,</hi> than their incapacity to take in what of his glory he is pleaſed to manifeſt; <hi>The Angels being ſaid alwayes to behold the face of God,</hi> Matth. 18.10. For, ſaith he, this is certain, that the nearer the Creature makes his approaches to God, and in the more glorious manner he is pleaſed to manifeſt <hi>himſelf,</hi> the more apprehenſive the Creature is, of its own meanneſs, baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vileneſs and nothingneſs, in regard of Gods infinite greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We are taught from the Scriptures, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine manifeſtations in Heaven, though they beget greateſt <hi>veneration,</hi> yet they cauſe <hi>pleaſure,</hi> not <hi>pain,</hi> and do rather <hi>nouriſh</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> the <hi>faculty,</hi> than any wayes <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> it; the veſſel ſhall be made capacious enough to hold any <hi>liquor</hi> which the thice bleſſed <hi>Trinity</hi> ſhall ſee meet to put into it.</p>
            <p>To this end we may take notice from Scripture it ſelf, that the glorified underſtanding ſhall be adorned with a ſix-fold perfection, <hi>ſcil.</hi>

            </p>

               </gap>, that <hi>great Gulf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſin is Hell.</note> which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates between God and the Creature; and ſurely ſin ſets a vaſter diſtance between the <hi>holy God</hi> and a <hi>ſinner,</hi> than there is between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> yea, than there is between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> that is, between <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>Creator,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> as he is a <hi>creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Until this diſtance be removed, there is no poſſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for the Soul to God; this <hi>partition wall is broken down</hi> when <hi>holineſs is ſet up;</hi> and according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>purity,</hi> is the degree of <hi>viſion,</hi> as the Soul paſſeth from one degree of <hi>holineſs</hi> to another, ſo it paſſeth from one ſtate and degree of viſion to another;

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Holineſs diſpoſeth for the viſion of God
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53915:126"/>by <hi>approximation</hi> and <hi>aſſimilating the Soul to God.</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the very <hi>Image of God,</hi> the <hi>divine nature,</hi> not in a <hi>fanatick</hi> ſenſe, not the <hi>divine being.</hi> Indeed holineſs in God is the <hi>divine eſſence,</hi> but holineſs in the Creature is but a <hi>gracious quality,</hi> whereby the Creature <hi>reſembleth God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15</note> and is made <hi>pure</hi> as he is <hi>pure, holy</hi> as he is <hi>holy.</hi> This advanceth the Soul to a nearer vicinity to God, whereby it is put into a <hi>paſſive capacity</hi> of ſeeing God; <hi>paſſive,</hi> I ſay, for the <hi>formal viſive</hi> power of ſeeing God, is from the <hi>object</hi> more than the <hi>ſubject</hi> of it, <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſo far as God is pleaſed to <hi>beam</hi> in his <hi>glory</hi> into the faculty, and enableth it to bear it;

            <p>Thirdly, Holineſs cauſeth mutual <hi>delight and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency between God and the Soul;</hi> all <hi>liking</hi> is founded in <hi>likeneſs; conformity</hi> is the fountain of <hi>complacency;</hi> ſo that until holineſs be formed in the Soul, neither can God <hi>delight</hi> in the <hi>Soul,</hi> nor the <hi>Soul</hi> in <hi>God</hi> verily without this mutual complacency, the viſion of God would be <hi>penal</hi> to the Creature, rather than <hi>beatifical,</hi> not much better than that viſion which the damned themſelves may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have of God in <hi>hell,</hi> whoſe viſion of God makes full one half of <hi>hell</hi> at leaſt;

            <p>Firſt, When God <hi>hath taken away Ordinances,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted men to take them away, then to live <hi>above them, i. e.</hi> to be able to live <hi>immediately upon God,</hi> as knowing, that though God hath <hi>tied us to means,</hi> he hath not tied himſelf to <hi>means;</hi> he that <hi>converts</hi> and <hi>ſaveth by</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, can do his work <hi>without</hi> them; the <hi>means</hi> can do nothing without God, but God can do what he will without the <hi>means;</hi> ſo to live by faith is exceeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the uſe of Ordinances, <hi>to look above Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> to look up to God, whoſe Ordinances they are, as only able to make his own <hi>Inſtitutions effectual</hi> to the accompliſhing of his own <hi>ends;</hi> thus to <hi>uſe</hi> Ordinances, and to truſt God, is excellent; but for a people while they have Ordinances to ſlight them, and neglect them, and talk of living <hi>above Ordinances,</hi> this is intollerable <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> yea, it is a <hi>mocking</hi> of God, to be <hi>wiſer</hi> than God, and inſtead of living above <hi>Ordinances,</hi> to live <hi>without God.</hi> Oh learn to make much of the Ordinances,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53915:129"/>leſt that angry queſtion come and ſweep away all, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wiſdom,
<note place="margin">Prov. 17.16</note> ſeeing he hath no heart to it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond thing I would call you to is, while you uſe Ordinances, <hi>to take heed of reſting in, and of reſting content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Ordinances;</hi> an <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> without <hi>the God of the Ordinance,</hi> what an empty glaſs is it? There is a viſion <hi>of</hi> Ordinances, and there is a viſion <hi>in</hi> Ordinances; oh take not up with <hi>that</hi> without <hi>this;</hi> pray for ſuch a ſpirit as he had, whoſe voice it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee: David</hi> was now in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> baniſhed from the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Ark, Altars,</hi> (thoſe legal Ordinances of the Sanctuary) I but it is not the bare Ordinances that will <hi>ſerve his turn,</hi> but <hi>God in the Ordinances, thee, thee, my ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee.</hi>

               <p>In which words, although he ſeem to ask God the <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi> yet he giveth himſelf the <hi>anſwer,</hi> and the <hi>anſwer</hi> is <hi>negative,</hi> q. d. <hi>No:</hi> God made not men in vain: It is not poſſible that the Wiſdom of God ſhould make ſuch an
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53915:149"/>excellent Creature as man (the maſter-piece of the whole <hi>neather world)</hi> to no purpoſe: It cannot be, that God ſhould bring in ſuch a Creature only to take a turn or two in the world, and then to <hi>diſappear,</hi> never to be heard of any more! What then? Why thence he doth rationally infer, that certainly in mans creation God had a deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, in order to a <hi>future eſtate:</hi> And what was that?

<note place="margin">Prov. 16, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf,</hi> i. e. for his own glory; <hi>ſcil.

               <p>Object. <hi>Yes, ſo we would, if we were ſure it were ours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> And is that the cauſe of your <hi>apathy</hi> and flatneſs of ſpirits to theſe heavenly fruitions? Truly, this very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty</hi> ſhould even ſtartle and affright us into an earneſt contention to make heaven ſure; ſo infinite a weight of glory, and we not aſcertained of our intereſt upon ſome good Scripture-evidence, is enough to make us to <hi>forget to eat our meat,</hi> enough to break our <hi>ſleep,</hi> and to <hi>keep our eyes waking</hi> all the night long, and to make us take little comfort in the preſent comforts we poſſeſs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Why,
<note place="margin">Evidence 1.</note> truly this one thing would amount to an evidence (and not the leaſt evidence) viz. <hi>Active en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to aſſure our ſelves of a ſhare in this Inheritance of the Saints;</hi> this would argue an high appretiation of this eſtate in the practical judgment, as moſt incomparably and abſolutely <hi>eligible;</hi> this is the very language of an heaven-born-ſoul, What have I to count upon but my treaſure which is in heaven? What buſineſs have I on earth comparable to this, to enſure my portion in heaven? for this cauſe I was born, and for this end I came into the world; the whole earth, in compariſon of heaven, is but a dunghill, <hi>Cabul,</hi>

               <p>This will argue a child-like ſpirit, Children mind their inheritance; abſent Children long to be at home at their Fathers houſe, they are often there in their thoughts and wiſhes: ſo the Saints, <hi>We groan within our ſelves, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from heaven</hi>— and, <hi>knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Evidence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Eſpecially if the <hi>holineſs</hi> of heaven do kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53915:165"/>thoſe deſires in us more than the <hi>happineſs,</hi> when a poor foul can truly ſay, I ſhould not account it an heaven, were it not that it is a land of holineſs, a land flowing with milk and honey of pure and immaculate joyes, that there the beauty of holineſs ſhines forth with uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable luſtre and glory, and there (ſaith the ſoul) I ſhall be in ſome degree like my God, <hi>glorious in holineſs;</hi> this is not only an <hi>evidence of heaven,</hi> but <hi>heaven</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Evidence 3.</note> Again, an <hi>univerſal hatred of ſin</hi> is a good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that heaven is deſigned for thee; for hatred of ſin is the negative part of holineſs, and heaven is a place provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God on purpoſe, that there the Saints may be as holy as they <hi>will</hi> without <hi>diſturbance</hi> or <hi>reproach:</hi> fear not to think much and often of <hi>heaven;</hi> if ſin be an offence to thee, if ſin be an hell on earth to thee, heaven is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee to be thy <hi>Paradiſe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Learned men conceive the ſin of the apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels went no further than the firſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious thought.</note> fear not to be often ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thy ſelf in the contemplation of that place where <hi>ſin never entred,</hi> or if it did, it was caſt out as ſoon as ever it was <hi>conceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed it is but a fancy men have taken up, that they love happineſs, while they continue to love ſin; a chaſt love of heaven can never conſiſt with the love of impure luſts.</p>
               <p>Sin is the <hi>Devils image,</hi> holineſs is Gods; he loves not the beauty of holineſs that would have the Devil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced thither; If men would not have it ſo, why elſe do they give ſin ſuch free entertainment in their own boſomes, and will by no means give it a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce?</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Evidence 4.</note> A ſuperlative love to him that hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this ſtate <hi>for us,</hi> and <hi>us for it,</hi> is an infallible evidence of our right to it, and intereſt in it, that is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and a ſtrong motive upon which gracious ſouls are ſo often in heaven by their contemplations, is, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53915:165"/>an eye of faith they may behold, not the <hi>purchaſe</hi> only, but the <hi>purchaſer, whom having not ſeen we love,</hi> and whom loving, we would fain ſee; and this is the glory of every one that is ſo affected; ſo it is expreſly ſaid,

Aſcend often in the Chariot of love, that thou mayeſt ſee his face, and in his face the glory and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heaven.

                  <hi>Is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well Chriſtians, you that would gladly have your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this glory, ſhut your eyes downward, I may invert the Angels Queſtion to the men of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and ſay,

               </p>
               <p>Yet give me leave to add one Caution, I do not ſay, every one that hath a right <hi>to</hi> heaven, hath an aſſurance <hi>of</hi> heaven, or elſe no right or warrant to meditate on heaven: but this I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:53915:166"/>1.

               <p n="3">3.

<note place="margin">1 King. 20.33</note> (with <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s ſervants) <hi>diligently to obſerve what words of comfort do fall from the lips of Scripture,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily <hi>to catch at them:</hi> q. d. Comfort another with theſe words: yea, Lord! with theſe words do thou comfort thy ſervant!</p>
               <p>We are uſually either ſenſleſs under, or ſwallowed up with great loſſes; either our bowels, are made of iron, or they melt like wax, and we faint away: Vehement ſorrow is like raging fire, that turns every thing into its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It's thy work therefore to ſtudy recruits, as well as to pore upon thy loſſes, to ballaſt thy ſoul with divine comforts: <hi>If I go not away the Comforter cannot come:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 16.7.</note> Many times the beſt of our earthly enjoyments ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and our heavenly conſolations: <hi>But if I go away I will ſend him unto you.</hi> It is good to reſolve with our ſelves, be my loſs in this world never ſo great, it is capable of a reparation. For certainly, if the loſs of Chriſt in his bodily preſence were to be repaired, there is nothing under the whole heaven, the loſs whereof we can ſuſtain, but may much eaſilier be made up with advantage, to be ſure the preſence of the Comforter is able to do it with an infinite overplus.

Thou oweſt them a debt of tears, haſt thou paid it? Now be juſt to thy ſelf, thou oweſt a care to thy ſoul, that thou ſin not, to thy ſpirit, that it ſink not; muſt thou needs dye, becauſe thy Husband, thy Child, thy Friend is dead? Look after divine conſolation, let it not be a ſmall thing to thee, neither ſay thou (by interpretation) nay, if God will have this comfort from me, let him take all.

                  </gap>, the altitude of it, that can fill a dying Saint with joy, or the ſurviving godly Mourners with comfort: whatever blaze unregenerate perſons make in the world, they go out like a ſtinking ſnuffe, but a Saint leaves a perſume behind him, he embalms his own death, he leaves every one of his weeping friends a Legacy of hope concerning his eternal ſtate; he ſets up a luſtre in the Houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, brighter than thoſe were with which Great mens Hearſes are watched, and in an inſtant turneth it into a Houſe of rejoycing; he is entered into glory, and hath left behind him the prints of his feet to guide us thither, and being dead yet ſpeaks to us, as Chriſt to <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene, Why weepeſt thou? The wicked is driven away in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53915:185"/>his wickedneſs, but the righteous hath hope in his death, Prov.</hi> 14.32: Study therefore, I ſay, an intereſt in Chriſt, that while you are raviſhed with the joyes of Heaven, you may leave comfort on Earth for your godly Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Carnal friends are ſatisfied with a negative holineſs for themſelves, or for their Relations that dye before them; to <hi>be better than the worſt</hi> is evidence enough to them of a bleſſed ſtate; or whatever their life hath been, put but in, a little dead repentance into the premiſes, they will put heaven into the concluſion; Oh, ſay they, <hi>he is happy, he is in heaven</hi> ſure enough.</p>
               <p>But Chriſtians, whoſe eyes have been opened to look into the horror of the bottomleſs pit, out of which free grace hath redeemed the Saints, the purity of the Goſpel rule, and the <hi>glory that ſhall be revealed at the appearance of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> they cannot take up with ſuch miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comforts as men uſually dye with. And it muſt needs be an addition to the torments of hell, to leave godly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations mourning under the dreadful apprehenſions of a Relation miſcarrying to all eternity. And to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of our friends anxiety of ſpirit even in this reſpect, is ſomewhat leſs charity than they have in hell. <hi>Dives</hi> in hell was ſollicitous to prevent his brethrens coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Graceleſs Relations dying, with the marks of their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy</hi> upon them, do even ſcorch the hearts of their gracious ſurviving friends, with the ſence of thoſe flames which they ſuffer. So it will be to them while they are yet in the body,
